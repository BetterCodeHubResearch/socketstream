<p>The common URL for a view is its name at the root level, but you can choose whatever you will calling <code>serveClient(..)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="url-scheme_assets">Assets</h3>
<p>The contents of the client assets directory will be served under <code>/assets</code>.</p>
<p>When views are packed for production they are saved under the client assets directory. This will change in the future
to make relative URLs work the same in development and production.</p>
<h3 id="url-scheme_middleware">Middleware</h3>
<p>At development time middleware is added to serve HTML, JS and CSS on the fly.</p>
<h3 id="url-scheme_serving-css">Serving CSS</h3>
<p>CSS files are served under /assets/<view>/123.css in production. When served ad hoc in development, and on-demand in
production all CSS must be served on the same level and ideally in an equivalent URL.</p>
<h3 id="url-scheme_js-module-paths">JS Module Paths</h3>
<h3 id="url-scheme_on-demand-loading">On Demand Loading</h3>
<p>The current on-demand fetching of JS is handled by middleware. It should be possible to do it using static files.</p>
<p>In production it would make sense to support a path like <code>/assets/require/..</code>.</p>
<p>We will have to consider whether all client code is considered completely open, or only partially. Should all client
modules be exported in minified form, or only those in a whitelist.</p>
