<p>Each view is served with a separate bundle of assets. A HTML, JS and CSS file makes up the view.
The default bundler will create the bundle based on the client definition as described in Client-Side Code and Client-Side Templates.</p>
<p>You can implement your own bundler and use it for a client definition. The bundlers are named and referenced by name.</p>
<p>Be aware the <em>API is experimental</em>. The current bundler is based on an early Browserify implementation, so it lacks some
features. The objective is to be able to move to bundling based on newer ones such as WebPack or JSPM. It should be possible
to implement a bundler that completely changes how the client is implemented. Hence there will be additional responsibilities
for bundlers in the future.</p>
<h5 id="client-side-bundler_custom-bundler">Custom Bundler</h5>
<p>You can define a custom bundler by implementing a bundler function that will be called for each client it is used on.</p>
<pre><code>function webpackBundler(ss, options) {
    var bundler = {};
    bundler.define = function(client,config,next_arg...) {};
    bundler.load = function() {};
    bundler.ensureAssetFolder = function() {}; // likely to be dropped
    bundler.asset = {
        html: function(path, opts, cb) { cb(output) },
        css: function(path, opts, cb) { cb(output) },
        js: function(path, opts, cb) { cb(output) },
        worker: function(path, opts, cb) { cb(output) }
    };
    bundler.pack = {
        css: function(cb) { cb(output); },
        js: function(cb) { cb(output); }
    };

    return bundler;
}
</code></pre><p>You can use a custom bundler by for a client view by specifying it in the definition.</p>
<pre><code>ss.client.define(&#39;discuss&#39;, webpackBundler, {
  view: &#39;./views/discuss.jade&#39;,
  css:  &#39;./css/discuss.scss&#39;,
  code: &#39;./code/discuss&#39;,
  tmpl: &#39;./templates/discuss&#39;
});
</code></pre><p>The define method of the bundler will be called to complete <code>ss.client.define</code>.</p>
<h5 id="client-side-bundler_bundler-define">Bundler Define <code>define(client,config,..)</code></h5>
<p>The define method will be called with a client object containing <code>id</code>, <code>name</code>,
If you pass additional arguments to define they will be passed to <code>bundler.define</code>. This may be dropped in the future.</p>
<h5 id="client-side-bundler_bundler-load">Bundler Load <code>load()</code></h5>
<p>The load method is called as the first step to load the client views. This is done as a bulk action as part of starting
the server.</p>
<h5 id="client-side-bundler_bundler-asset-methods">Bundler asset methods</h5>
<p>For each of the asset types supported individual files can be served during development.
A callback function is passed, and must be called with the text contents.</p>
<h5 id="client-side-bundler_bundler-pack-methods">Bundler pack methods</h5>
<p>Files are saved in the assets directory for production use. The HTML file is the same as the one used during development,
so the <code>asset.html</code> method will be called. For JS and CSS the pack methods are called to do additional minification and
other optimisations.</p>
