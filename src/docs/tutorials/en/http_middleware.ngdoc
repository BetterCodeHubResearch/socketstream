# HTTP Middleware

SocketStream no longer provides a stack of Connect HTTP middleware which is used internally to serve single-page clients, asset files and static files (e.g. images) in `client/static`.

Session handling is done in add-ons like `socketstream-cookie-session`.

For additional middleware follow the examples for Connect or ExpressJS.
